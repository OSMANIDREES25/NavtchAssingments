    <h2>About Our School</h2>
    <p>About National Pre Cadre High School - Official
        National Pre Cadre School was established in April 2000. The nationalization of educational institutions in 2000 had led to an alarming decline in the standards of instruction and facilities being provided in most schools and colleges. Interventions in the realm of education were therefore, critical to arrest this abysmal state of affairs.
        
        Today National Pre Cadre HighSchool provides education to both boys and girls till Metric. It has extended its network to cater to the needs of the middle income group in its Landmark Schools. It offers quality education.
        
        The philosophy of this institution is a holistic and dynamic one and one that appreciates diversity and stresses the importance of opinions based on rational and informed premises rather that on superstition, emotion and insufficient understanding of issues. Emphasis is laid on the understanding of concepts and creating a culture of thinking in the classroom. Education is seen as a broad and complex process of acquiring knowledge and understanding.
        
        We have taken several initiatives in the field of education including the promotion of the performing arts that the Board of Administration (NPCS)  felt were being neglected at great cost to our cultural tradition and a healthier social milieu.
        
        In addition, the General Studies program was devised to make students more aware of contemporary issues, both national and world wide and their role not only in developing an understanding of these issues but prompting a desire to translate that knowledge into active commitment and take steps, where possible, to bring about positive change in their own environment.
        
        NPCS  also lays great emphasis on the teaching of regional languages so that students develop an appreciation of their cultural roots and a pride in the rich traditions of literature and music of their province.
        
        A critical element of our program other than a wide range of academic disciplines and music, sports, dance, mime, debate, drama, poetry recitation, is community service where students are encouraged to share their skills and learn from the courage and resilience of those less fortunate than themselves. 
        
        The school is affiliated with the Lahore Board Examinations. The grading system applied in the senior levels is in line with the specifications of the Board and is indicated on the school transcript.
        
        The outstanding results attained by our students in these examinations reflect the importance given to our aim which is to maintain high standards in academics while not compromising our commitment to our motto to promote a wide range of activities that enrich not only the mind but the spirit, as well.</p>
